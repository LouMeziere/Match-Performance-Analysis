# RBNY vs NYCFC Performance Analysis

# Description
The goal of this project is to explore the factors contributing to RBNYâ€™s 5-1 loss to NYCFC in the 2024 soccer season. Using season data from both teams, we aim to identify performance metrics that correlate with goal-scoring success. We analyze key statistics such as on-target scoring attempts, player positions (attackers, midfielders, and defenders), and team-level performance to determine potential reasons behind the heavy defeat.
